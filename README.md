Hey guys, this is No√©mi Rumpeltin. 
I've only recently started learning about web development and programming overall, so this is my first serious project.

There will be a lot more to come though! Be patient and stick around, then you'll discover a bunch of projects here soon.

If you have any tips, like how to vertically center stubborn divs in the index file without my img going crazy, you're very welcome to share them with me.. ^^
See you around!
